# LiDAR
ME595 

## Build
1. .pcap files are too big for Github, download the montery highway pcap from here  https://midas3.kitware.com/midas/folder/12979
2. rename it to "Highway.pcap" and place it in the same directory as this.
3. On Ubuntu
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -lpcap
    ```
4. `./a.out` to run. 
5.  On the standard settings, it should print "Hello There"x8 and since this prints every 8 packets. Highway.lcap has 8x8 = 64 packets

Output: 

```
Hello world!
Hello thereHello thereHello thereHello thereHello thereHello thereHello thereHello therecapture finished
```
